    This is a project provided by UCB department of EECS in 21 SP, and I post it here as one of the big projects I have completed.

    Specs, skeleton code and librarys are provided too, so people can see what exactly that I have done.

    This is a mini version of the Git program, and it involves persistence. I design the program so that each specific dir/file coressponse to a java class.
For instance, AddStage is a repository class, where AddStage.init() make a director inside CWD, and AddStage.del(fileName) would delete that file from add-stage, making it no longer candidate for adding in the next commit.
